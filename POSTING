---------- Names -------------------
You can register a name at 1/register.

Name requirements:
  * Alphanumeric, underscore, dashes only
  * Maximum 16 characters in length
  * Must not case-insensitive match an existing name (e.g. if a name "User1"
    already exists, "user1", "USER1" etc. cannot be registered).

Password requirements:
  * Any length
  * Exclamation points are acceptable
  * Spaces are not allowed

Please don't use a password that you care about. Gopher is an insecure protocol.

Once you register, you can start your post with "!Name!your_password" to use
your name.

Your password can be changed at a later time at 1/changepw.

---------- Images ------------------
You can start your post (after your "!Name" if you include one) with a URL
(starting with "http" or "https") to an image < 1 MiB in order to upload it.

e.g.

  !Name!your_password http://example.com/image.jpg body of the text post

or

  http://example.com/image.jpg body of the text post

---------- Deleting posts ----------
If the post is Anonymous, your deletion password will be "password" (but your
IP address must match!)

Otherwise, use your "!Name" password.

---------- Anti-spam ---------------
Each board currently has a separate cool-down time of 2 minutes as an
anti-spam measure, meaning one must wait 2 minutes after the last post
(reply or original post) before a new post can be made.
