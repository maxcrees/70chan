This is a (WIP) rewrite of port70.net's gopherchan[1] in Python 3.

[1] gopher://port70.net/1chan
    http://port70.net/?1chan

* To add a board:
  ./newboard.sh 'boardname'

* To change hostname, change:
  config.ini $server.host
  /etc/xinet.d/mgod
  httpgate.cfg.h

* config.ini must be in the same directory as .gopher.rec
