This is a (WIP) rewrite of port70.net's gopherchan[1] in Python 3.

[1] gopher://port70.net/1chan
    http://port70.net/?1chan

* To setup:
  # Edit data/config.ini.sample and move to data/config.ini
  ./scripts/setup.sh
* When running in conjunction with mgod and httpgate, I recommend using
  the user mgod runs under as the owner, and the user the HTTP server (and
  thus httpgate) runs under as the group.
* To add a board:
  ./newboard.sh 'boardname' 'description'
  # then chown and chmod data/words.$boardname as appropriate
* To change hostname, modify:
  data/config.ini $server.host
  /etc/xinet.d/mgod
  httpgate.cfg.h
